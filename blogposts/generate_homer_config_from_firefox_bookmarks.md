In Mid-August (2021), I was looking for a self-hosted "dashboard." These dashboards give you a way to create a
customizable new tab page. During my research, I came across [Homer](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer), a simple
self-hosted dashboard that can be deployed quickly with docker. After playing with homer a little bit, I made a joke
to a friend about writing a script that would automatically generate a dashboard config file based on my firefox
bookmarks. After doing a little bit of research on how firefox bookmarks are stored, I decided to give it a try.
